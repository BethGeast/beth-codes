    <h3>This site!</h3>
    <p>This website is the most recent of my personal coding
      projects. Built from the ground up as a totally solo
      project, this has creatively been a lot of fun, as I've
      had complete freedom over design choices and color palettes üòÅ
      although solo working comes with its downsides - you don't
      have that second set of eyes for any debugging!
    </p>
    <p>Creating a working contact form seemed like it would be
      such a straightforwards task, but coding this for the first
      time (there's always a first time for everything, right?)
      was probably the trickiest part of this project. But that
      work paid off, and it makes me very satisfied to see it now
      working in both development and production environments!
      Why don't you try it out yourself by clicking on "message me"
      on my contact page...?

    <h3>GigBuddy</h3>
    <p>A mobile app for users to find others with whom
      they share a music taste, allowing new friendships
      to be made and with the idea for users to find friends
      to attend music concerts with.
    </p>
    <p>This was my final project during the Le Wagon bootcamp
      I completed earlier this year. I was the lead developer for
      this project, in a group with two other students, after
      initially pitching the rough idea around half-way through
      the course. In under ten days, we went from fully realising
      what the features of the app would be, forming all user
      stories and wireframing to presenting the working product,
      in production, to a live audience.
    </p>

    <h3>Dogbnb</h3>
    <p>A website for dog owners to find kennels/accommodation
      for their pet to stay in whilst they are away.
    </p>
    <p>Prior to our final projects, we were tasked with
      creating a clone Airbnb website as a mock project.
      In less than five days, myself (again as lead developer)
      and my two teammates went from deciding on our own
      approach to the 'Airbnb' style site, through user stories
      and wireframing, to presenting the completed site on
      the afternoon of the fifth day. This challenge was my
      introduction to working on a full project and as a team,
      handling task delegation, different branches and the conflicts
      which would inevitably appear. We were very ambitious as
      a team, and although had hoped to add a few more features,
      I am proud of what we achieved as a first teamworking
      project, and in less than five days start to finish!

    <h3>LocalMarket</h3>
    <p>After completion of my web development course, I was approached and asked if
      I wanted to be involved in a new project a friend had an idea for - an online
      marketplace for users to find local farmers/producers of homegrown food
      products (e.g. milk, eggs, fruits, vegetables etc.), or for these farmers
      to list their produce online for others to find and buy. My role in this
      project was assisting with the creation and set-up of the back-end side of
      the application.
    </p>
    <h5>Technical Features I was involved in:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Creating the ActiveRecord database/schema with associations, all models (and required
        validations for each), controllers and view pages, along with their matching routes,
        and ActiveStorage and Cloudinary for image upload
      </li>
      <li>Installing and implementing Devise and Pundit Ruby Gems, to handle secure user
        sign-in/sign-up, authentication and authorization
      </li>
